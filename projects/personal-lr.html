            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Traditional linear rails, while precise and robust, are often expensive and require specialized manufacturing processes. This makes them inaccessible for many hobbyist projects and rapid prototyping applications. Commercial linear rails also come in fixed sizes and preload settings, limiting their adaptability to specific project needs. The challenge was to create a fully 3D printable linear rail system that could match the smooth operation and precision of commercial rails while being cost-effective and customizable.</p>

                <p>I developed a complete linear rail system that could be manufactured primarily through 3D printing, with only the bearing balls needing to be purchased. The design incorporates several innovative features to achieve smooth, precise motion while maintaining adjustability.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed a recirculating ball bearing system that allows for continuous linear motion with minimal friction</li>
                    <li>Created an adjustable preload mechanism that can be tuned after assembly to optimize between smoothness and rigidity</li>
                    <li>Engineered precise ball return pathways to ensure smooth transition of bearing balls between loaded and return channels</li>
                    <li>Developed a modular design that allows for easy customization of rail length and bearing block size</li>
                    <li>Optimized the design for FDM 3D printing, considering layer adhesion strength and print orientation</li>
                    <li>Implemented features to allow for easy assembly and maintenance, including access points for ball insertion and removal</li>

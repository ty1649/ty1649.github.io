                <p>My group and I decided to make a 3 wheeled electric go kart as a part of an engineering class. We were offered
                    wheels, the makerspace, 80/20 extrusions, round stock, an electric motor, and a tiny amount of money to make it work. We also
                    decided to make our go kart pirate ship themed -- which meant it had to be pointy at the front, hence the 3 wheels!
                </p>
            </div>            
        </section>

        <section id="summary" class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Summary</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    We started off with dividing the work between us for different subassemblies, which included the 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Chassis</li>
                        <li>Steering</li>
                        <li>Drivetrain</li>
                        <li>Cockpit (Gas/Brake Pedals)</li>
                        <li>Integration</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this division of tasks, we all collaborated on a top assembly and finished our CAD (with over 130 components in the total assembly).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we couldn't afford a U-Joint, we used a bevel-gear based system for single wheel steering in the front,
                    fastened to the chassis with 3d printed parts and fasteners, and a custom plasma cut gusset for concentric alignment.
                    Our chassis featured 80/20 gussets that were FEA analyzed, and secured together with more plasma cut gussets and fasteners.
                    Our battery powered 2 BLDC motors, one per rear wheel, which were connected with belts and a determined ratio via the FDM 3D printed 
                    drivetrain components to the wheels. Our brakes engaged with a bike brake that pressed against the wheels when activated.
                    We made our chassis as skinny/short as possible, based off the measurement of our shortest friend, to 
                    ensure weight savings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, to stay in theme, we had our pedals have a pirate symbol be imprinted on them, our steering wheel be a pirate ship wheel that we CAD-ded,
                    and our drivetrain components to 'look' like beefy tridents (while passing the testing under max torque).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had to take special note to make sure that the components we were designing were able to be manufactured/made, or bought cheaply, and when assembling
                    was possible to be able to be put on. This was a big issue in some chassis components, which we had to re-design -- but in the end,
                    we got everything on the kart and it worked!
                </p>

                <p><b>Situation:</b> To enhance my ability to create handwritten letters and draw better pictures, I embarked on a project to build a pen plotter. The goal was to design and construct every component of the plotter, from the mechanical parts to the electrical wiring, and to develop the control theory from scratch to determine motor actions.</p>
                <p><b>Task:</b> The project is still a work in progress, with the final task being the 3D printing of the pen holding mechanism. The electrical and software components have been completed, but the mechanical aspect requires further development.</p>

                <p><b>Action:</b></p>
                <b>Mechanical:</b>
                <p>I began by designing the mechanical components, aiming to fabricate as much as possible myself. Initially, I avoided purchasing linear rails, opting instead to buy bearing balls and 3D print recirculating ball bearings. This decision required several iterations, which are documented here. I chose a CoreXY belt configuration after evaluating other Cartesian XY gantry designs, as it allowed the large stepper motor to remain stationary. Designing this system was challenging, ensuring belt alignment and pulley placement were correct. I used heat set inserts and fasteners to secure the pulleys and belts, necessitating some redesigns. Additionally, I developed a secure belt tensioning system and a stable frame to support the gantry's movement.</p>
                <b>Software:</b>

                <p>The software was designed to generate GCode, instructing the motors on pen movements based on input images. My vision was for the plotter to trace and draw images, potentially swapping colors in the future. Initially, I applied blur and edge detection kernels, but the results were unsatisfactory. I then implemented k-means clustering to classify image colors, followed by edge detection to create SVG-like chains for the motors to follow. This approach was effective, and I also implemented a 45 degree image rotation and scaling due to the CoreXY configuration. The resulting GCode was extensive, exceeding the Arduino's capacity. To address this, I developed a Python script to send GCode in batches of 50, allowing the Arduino to request more as needed. This solution required extensive tuning of data transmission and baud rates.</p>
                <b>Electrical:</b>
                <p>This project was my most complex electronics endeavor. Initially, I used A4988 stepper motor drivers with an Arduino CNC Shield, but they overheated and shorted under the CoreXY tension. I switched to TMC2208 drivers, which performed better. I also purchased a 12V 60W power supply from AliExpress, which failed initially, so I had to debug and buy a replacement.</p>
                <p><b>Result:</b> After significant debugging, the system functioned as intended. The Arduino simultaneously processes GCode and sends timed pulses to the stepper motor, managing these tasks at different speeds. This project provided valuable insights into integration between mechanical design, software development, and electrical engineering, despite the challenges faced along the way.</p>
